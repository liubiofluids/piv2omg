Finding the velocity field of a masked area (for a rotating object) through particle image velocimetry (PIV), the associated angular velocity and axial position for a rigid body. The main code is "Cluster2PIV," which outputs both the angular velocity (with 3 components) and z position, i.e., [vomg, vz]=Cluster2PIV(...).
